If it’s still blocked on your network, feel free to drop a comment for help.

(However it shouldnt be as it is a HTML file and schools cant block HTML files from being opened)

# How to Use
Open the `.html` file included in this repo.

Click the download icon.

Once the download is complete, open the file.

It should open in a new tab, and you're good to go!

Note: If you don’t know how HTML files work, just open it via your file manager and it should open in your default web browser. That’s it.
